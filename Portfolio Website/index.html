		<h1>FFXI Modding:</h1>
		<p>I'm a big fan of the FINAL FANTASY games from Square-Enix, and I'm particularly fond of FINAL FANTASY XI, which is the first MMORPG in the FINAL FANTASY franchise. As a game modder, I have a personal project going in which I've been ripping the art assets from FFXI and then importing and reassembling those assets in Unreal Engine 4. You can see the results of this project on a YouTube channel that I run called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/ffximodding">FFXI Modding</a>. Some of the videos from that channel are displayed below. Please note that I did <b><i>not</i></b> create the art assets in these videos. Square-Enix created these assets. What I did was extract the assets from the FFXI game files using a special 3D ripping program, and then reassemble the assets in Unreal Engine 4. This was a personal project done as an independant game modder, and I did not receive any sort of payment or authorization from Square-Enix (or anyone else) for this project. I am not affiliated with Square-Enix.</p>

And so the farmer decides that the monarchy and everyone who serves it is evil, and vows to topple the throne and bring about a revolution. But in order to do so, he must overcome waves of organized, regimented henchmen by joining an anti-monarchist rebellion and enlisting their aid, all so that he can fight his way into the castle and slay the evil King along with all the members of the royal family, thereby avenging his son's death and bringing freedom to the land.</p>

		<h1>About Me</h1>
		
		<img src="images/portrait_photo_thumbnail.jpg" class="photo" alt="Portrait" />
		

		<div class="centering_inner_div">
			<div class="column">
				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p>I am currently a student at Utah Valley University where I am majoring in Digital Media with an emphasis in Game Design and Animation, and a minor in Computer Science, along with studies in graphic design, web design, and creative writing. I will be graduating with my bachelor's degree in May of 2019.</p>
			</div> <!-- END COLUMN -->

			<div class="column">
				<h2>Experience</h2>
				<p>As an aspiring entrepreneur, I have established and launched my own one-man video game development company, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6210712367277117928">Nineteen Seventeen Studios LLC</a>, through which I have published a single small indie game titled <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=unity.NineteenSeventeenStudios.NaziZombieHunter"><i>Nazi Zombie Hunter</i></a>, which was developed for Android devices using the Unity game engine.</p>
			</div> <!-- END COLUMN -->

			<div class="column">
				<h2>Military Service</h2>
				<p>I have served nearly ten years in the U.S. Army Reserves (from October 2009 to April 2019), where I developed the personal character traits of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage. Although I never deployed, I nevertheless assisted fellow military service members in conflict resolution exercises during monthly training assemblies where I gained skills in leadership, discipline and experience that promoted character and skill growth as we learned to quickly assess the proper tools to resolve potentially dangerous situations and circumstances.</p>
			</div> <!-- END COLUMN -->

			<div class="column">
				<h2>Skillset</h2>
				<p>I possess a strong creative mind, and I seek to express own artistic vision through both visual and written mediums. I have a natural talent for creative writing, and enjoy weaving unique narratives with compelling characters. I have a keen eye for visual structure and aesthetic flow, which I use to create compelling visual works. During my university studies, I mastered the fundamentals of Autodesk Maya, and I've been using Adobe Photoshop informally since I was a teenager. I've studied computer programming, having taken university classes on C#, C++, Java, as well as HTML and CSS. I am knowledgeable in the use of both the Unity game engine and Unreal Engine 4. As an indie game developer, I've had to wear a lot of creative hats, so to speak.</p>

			<div class="column">
				<h2>Passions</h2>
				<p>Since childhood, I've had a strong passion for video games, cartoons, fantasy, science fiction, and all things nerdy and geeky. I enjoy writing creative fiction, which has served me well during games of Dungeons & Dragons. In high school, I enjoyed drawing comics that parodied popular video games, creating pixel art in MS Paint, and making my own games in <a href="http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/programs/rpg-maker-2003">RPG Maker</a>. Though I have since moved on to more professional game engines like Unity and Unreal, the games I made in RPG Maker during my youth nevertheless motivated me to become a professional game developer. As an entrepreneur, I make a deliberate habit of reading self-help books about business development, as well as reading thick tomes on economics and high philosophy. Additionally, I have a firm belief in equality, diversity, and civil rights. We're all human, and creating safe, inclusive communities where everybody can feel accepted and welcome is vitally important to building a just and civil society.</p>
