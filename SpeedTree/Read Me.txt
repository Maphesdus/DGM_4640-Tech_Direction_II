These are custom SpeedTrees which I made myself. In order to make them, I purchased a one month licence to SpeedTree for Unity for $19. I also made the textures myself by taking photographs of a tree on the UVU campus and then editing the photos in Photoshop in order to make them tile seamlessly. This gave me a nice, realistic bark texture. I also used Photoshop to create the normals maps from the bark texture.
